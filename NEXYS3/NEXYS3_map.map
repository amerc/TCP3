ERROR:Place:543 - This design does not fit into the number of slices available
   in this device due to the complexity of the design and/or constraints.

   Unplaced instances by type:

     BLOCKRAM    4 (10.8%)

   Please evaluate the following:

   - If there are user-defined constraints or area groups:
     Please look at the "User-defined constraints" section below to determine
     what constraints might be impacting the fitting of this design.
     Evaluate if they can be moved, removed or resized to allow for fitting.
     Verify that they do not overlap or conflict with clock region restrictions.
     See the clock region reports in the MAP log file (*map) for more details
     on clock region usage.

   - If there is difficulty in placing LUTs:
     Try using the MAP LUT Combining Option (map lc area|auto|off).

   - If there is difficulty in placing FFs:
     Evaluate the number and configuration of the control sets in your design.

   The following instances are the last set of instances that failed to place:
